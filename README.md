# rust-ndi-sdk (`ndi-sdk-sys`)

[![Crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ndi-sdk-sys.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/ndi-sdk-sys)
[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/ndi-sdk-sys/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/ndi-sdk-sys)

(WIP) Safe Rust bindings for the [NDI](https://ndi.video/) SDK, enabling
high-performance video, audio, and metadata transmission over IP networks.

## Features

- Safe wrapper around the NDI SDK
- Currently supports:
  - Finder API for discovering NDI sources
  - Router API for routing NDI streams
- Not implemented yet:
  - Sender API for transmitting NDI streams
  - Receiver API for receiving NDI streams

## Version compatibility

This crate is currently tested against SDK version 6.1.1.0

The raw bindings are generated from the header files in the SDK installation
directory, this way generated code will always match the version it is compiled
with and linked against.

## Platform Support

This crates `build.rs` is currently lacking support for platforms other than
Windows x64, if you are working on another platform, feel free to add support
for it. (It shouldn't be that complicated, windows support is less than 40 lines
of nearly-boilerplate code)

## Installation

1. Make sure to have the [NDI SDK](https://ndi.video/for-developers/#ndi-sdk)
   installed
2. Add `ndi-sdk-sys` ro your cargo dependencies

Check out the examples at
https://github.com/deno-plc/rust-ndi-sdk/tree/main/examples

## Safety

This crate provides safe abstractions of the NDI SDK. The public API is designed
to be 100% safe to use. If you encounter restrictive lifetimes, do not try to
circumvent them, mot likely it just represents the safety requirements of the C
SDK.

As expected form a C library, safety requirements are not always documented
in-depth. One common assumption this crate uses it that it is safe to drop
configuration objects that are passed as pointers (and strings inside them)
immediately after the call they were passed to has returned.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

1. Add support for other platforms in `build.rs`
2. Implement bindings for Receiver/Sender
3. Report bugs and suggest features
4. Improve documentation and examples
